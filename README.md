# Coeur - static site management

Coeur is just another Python tool to generate static sites with thousands of pages, with a bit of extra power.

## Name explanation

"cœur" is a French word for "core" or "heart".

This tool is called Coeur for two personal reasons: 1. it will be the core of my blog-farm; 2. one of my favorite places is the Sacre ***Cœur*** in Paris.

## How to install

Coeur is a common python package, you can install from pypi:

```sh
pip install --user blog-coeur
```

The command to be used is `blog-coeur` and get `help` to start to use:

```sh
blog-coeur --help
```

## Module SSG - Static Site Generator

The `ssg` module in **Coeur** allows you to create a static website from a `sqlite` database and import content from markdown files.

### How to Use

#### Create Your Coeur App

To start a new project, run the `create` command:

```
blog-coeur ssg create my-blog
```

#### Development Server

Run a simple local server to build your blog:

```
blog-coeur ssg server --max-posts=1000 --port=8081
```

#### Admin Web Panel

Manage your blog’s posts through a web dashboard (static HTML + REST API):

```
blog-coeur ssg admin
```

Go to: `http://localhost:8000/`

**Admin module** — The admin is a single-page app served by the same process. It lets you:

- **Search / list posts:** Choose a database (or "All"), then search by title or leave the search empty and click Search to list posts paginated. Results open in the left panel.
- **Edit a post:** Click a result to load it. The main area shows two columns: editable fields (title, content, path, date, image) on the left and a live preview on the right. Content supports HTML or Markdown; Markdown is rendered in the preview.
- **Rich editor:** Toolbar (bold, italic, headings, lists, link) for the content. Use "View source" to switch between WYSIWYG and raw HTML/Markdown; for Markdown posts, the source view shows Markdown.
- **Update:** Click "Update post" to save changes. The API is REST (GET/PUT); the navbar link "API (Swagger)" opens the interactive docs at `/docs`.

#### Build Static Site

Build your blog with the `build` command:

```
blog-coeur ssg build
```

The blog will be generated in the `public` folder.

#### Markdown Import

To import your markdown files from Zola Framework to Coeur:

```
blog-coeur ssg markdown-to-db "./content"
```

### SSG Features

- Import markdown files from Zola Framework
- Basic blog template based on Zolarwind
- HTML Minification
- Sitemap generation with pagination
- Hot reload
- Admin dashboard: search/list posts, rich editor, view source (HTML/Markdown), update via REST API with Swagger at `/docs`

 ### TODO List

- [ ] Custom templates (themes)
    - [ ] Documentation about templates
- [ ] Support to use post Tags
- [ ] Hot reload v2 - add websocket to auto-refresh the html in the browser


## Module CMP - Content Machine Processor

The CMP module was designed to simplify content creation powered by the OpenAI API.

### How to Use

The content will be created as posts inside the blog's SQLite database, which is generated by the ssg module. It's important to start your project using the ssg command.

Assuming you already have the blog created with Coeur, you need to set up your OpenAI key in the `.env` file and then you can use the cmp module as follows:

```
blog-coeur cmp title-to-post "Aguas de Lindóia" --custom-prompt="Create a full article about the city, need to be funny and talking in a positive way about the place"
```

The first parameter is required and will be the title of the post.

It is highly recommended to use a custom-prompt to enhance your experience and get better results. This prompt can be in any language.

You can also set the `img-url` parameter to include an image in the post. This needs to be a valid image URL, such as one hosted on S3.


## Module PDS – Post Distribution Service

This module will help us to automatically publish the blog posts on social media.

```
blog-coeur pds publish [OPTIONS] CHANNELS:{instagram}...
```
