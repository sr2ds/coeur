# Migration Guide: Version 0.0.12

## Introduction

Starting from **version 0.0.12** of Coeur, significant changes have been made to the database to include **UUIDs** and a **db** field. To update your project to the latest version, please follow the steps below.

## How to Update Your Project

To ensure your project is updated to version 0.0.12 or higher, simply execute the migration script. This will update the database and apply the necessary changes.

### Migration Steps

1. **Run the migration script**:  
   Execute the `migration.py` script (or the equivalent file containing the migration functions). This will ensure the database changes, such as adding the `uuid` and `db` columns, are applied correctly.

2. **Minimum Coeur Version**:  
   After running the migration, you should update your Coeur version to **0.0.12** or higher to ensure compatibility with the updated database.

   - If you're using an older version of Coeur, please update it using your dependency manager (e.g., **Poetry**, **pip**, or other).
   - To ensure the correct version of Coeur is installed, use the following command (if you're using Poetry):

     ```bash
     poetry add coeur@^0.0.12
     ```

3. **Check the Update**:  
   After running the migration and ensuring the correct version of Coeur is installed, verify that the database has been updated correctly. The `posts` table should now contain the new `uuid` and `db` columns.

### What Has Changed?

- The `posts` table has been modified to include the `uuid` column, which now serves as the unique identifier for each record.
- The `db` column has been added to track which database each entry comes from, making data maintenance and organization easier.
- The database has been compacted using the `VACUUM` command to improve performance and reduce fragmentation.

## Final Considerations

Running this script is required to ensure your project continues to work correctly with the latest versions of Coeur. If you have any questions or encounter issues during the process, feel free to contact support.

Good migration and success with Coeur!
